# Strava Privacy Helper

This program will help you set privacy settings on your strava activities according to the type of activity. For example, you can set your runs to `everyone` and weight training activities to `only_me`. 

`npm i -g strava-privacy`

## The problem 

Strava does not have an option to set privacy settings based on activity type. You can only edit privacy settings for all your activities. Furthermore, the Strava API does not allow setting the visibility of your activities either. 

## The Solution

Strava Privacy Helper uses a combination of strava api and web interface to edit visibility setting for your existing or even newer activites with rules based on activity type.
